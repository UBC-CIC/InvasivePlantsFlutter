# Invasive Plants App User Guide

This Invasive Plants App currently allows users to identify invasive plants in two Canadian provinces: British Columbia and Ontario, and suggests alternative non-invasive plants to plant instead.

## Log in and Sign up

Upon loading the app, the user will be prompted to log in with their email. Sign up is only necessary if the user plans to save plants into custom [lists](#lists). Otherwise, the user can select `Continue as Guest`, which will provide access to all other features.
![sign up page](TODO)

## Home Page

After logging in or continuing as guest, the user will be brought to the Home Page. Here, the user can select their location.
![select user location](TODO)

This will provide a list of all invasive plants that fall within the selected region. The app currently supports identifying invasive plants in British Columbia and Ontario. The user can then scroll through and browse this list or they can search up a specific invasive plant.
![home page](TODO)

At the top left corner of the Home Page, there is a profile icon that can be clicked. This will bring the user to the [Settings page](#settings).

## Navbar

There will be a navbar at the bottom of the screen with three icons. The home icon brings the user to the [Home Page](#home-page), the camera icon to the [camera](#camera), and the save icon to the user's [lists](#lists).
![navbar](TODO)

## Settings

In Settings, the user can choose to [create an account](#user-creation). There is also the option set the app's language in French, however this feature is not currently supported.
![settings](TODO)

## Plant Identification

The following section will explain how a user can identify an invasive plant and measure to take.

### Camera

The user can either take a photo of a plant or upload an existing photo.
![camera](TODO)

Next, the user can select what part of the plant they took the picture of, including: leaf, flower, fruit, or bark.
![select plant organ](TODO)

Click on `find matches` to see which plants are the best match.

### Plant matches

If no matches are found, the user will be prompted to retake/reupload a photo.
![no match](TODO)

Otherwise, the user will be provided with the best 3 matches. Matches that are invasive species will be marked, otherwise, assume that the plant match is non-invasive in the user's location. Each match preview will provide its scientific name(s) and common name(s), a similarity score, plant images, and also the option to [learn more](plant-info) about the plant.

![match non-invasive](TODO)
![match invasive](TODO)

### Plant info

After clicking into a plant, the user will be provided with its plant information, such as a description and images. If the plant is invasive, the `alternatives` tab provides with a list of similar non-invasive species to plant instead. At the bottom of each page, users will find links to external sources providing further information on the plant.
![plant information](TODO)

The user can also choose to save the plant to a [list](#lists) by clicking on the save icon next to the plant's name.
![save plant](TODO)

## Lists

To access the lists feature, users are required to [log in](#log-in-and-sign-up). This functionality allows users to create personalized plant lists for better organization and convenient future access.
![all lists](TODO)
![specific list example](TODO)
